<h1>About us!</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Karen, and this is a little about me.....
I love my children
I love my family
I love my friends
I believe in the arts and crafts as an integral part of our lives
I must be challenged
I have more ideas than time
I want to change the paradigm of 'starving artist' to 'thriving artist'
I love to play...</p>

<p>What else is there?</p>

<p>OK, I guess there is a bit more. I was a stay at home Momma of 3 amazing children Lucas (20), Lauren (18), and EsaBella (7). Creativity has been a lifelong insatiable passion and I've picked up many skills along the way. I was taught to knit, embroider, and cross stitch at young age by my Oma, as a teen I would sew my own clothes (or what we now call up-cycled - reinvent my clothes), was an honours grad in high school with an arts major.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 1996 - 2000 I owned and operated my first business: a paint-your-own ceramic studio in Squamish where I taught classes, had arranged for Emily Carr College to teach classes in my studio, and was president of the Squamish Arts Council...busy times.</p>

<p>Fast forward one more time to 2009, and as I witness the erosion of support for the arts I make a decision to create a place to not only support the arts but to connect community through the arts. This is what I am meant to do. I am a creative catalyst and a great promoter...so let's see what we can all create!</p>
